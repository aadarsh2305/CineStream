# Movie List Web Application

This project is a movie listing web application built using **React** and **Vite**. The interface showcases a sample list of movies with an interactive UI that displays movie details like genre, release year, and duration. This project is currently focused on the frontend, with plans to integrate a backend for video streaming.

## Features

- **Responsive UI**: Displays movie posters, titles, genres, and other details.
- **Dark Mode**: The application uses a dark-themed interface by default for a sleek and modern look.
- **Interactive Watch Button**: Each movie card has a "Watch Now" button that will link to the movie stream (placeholder for now).

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite
- **Styling**: CSS with dark theme design
- **Port**: The app runs on [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

## Future Plans

- **Backend Integration**: I plan to add a backend using a technology stack that will allow for video streaming. This will fetch movie data directly from a cloud source and stream it in real time.
- **Expanded Movie List**: The current list is limited to two sample movies due to storage constraints. With the backend, the app will support a larger library of movies.
